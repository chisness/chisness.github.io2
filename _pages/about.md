I'm interested in AI and machine learning, specifically reinforcement learning and games and also AI Safety. I wrote my MSc thesis on [Counterfactual Regret Minimization and Abstraction Analysis in Computer Poker](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jcgszjng6u5gj0b/MaxChiswickCFRThesis.pdf?dl=0) (finished at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in 2017). 

## Other Info
- I enjoy hiking and cycling, which has recently involved lots of Citibiking and dodging tourists on the Brooklyn Bridge and some hiking in Israel
- I like studying languages, but am currently only at a strong conversational level in Hebrew. I hope to spend time on French, Spanish, and Arabic in the future.
